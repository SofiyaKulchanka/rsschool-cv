### About Me
Hi! My name is Sofiya and I am 17 years old. I was born in Belarus, but for the last 2 years I have been living and studying in Warsaw, Poland. 

In my opinion, my main strengths are discipline, determination and consistency. I easily get fired up by ideas, but at the same time work diligently to implement them. I also often hear that I am a quick learner.  

 I have programming experience in game development  (C# and Unity), but for my own purposes. 
 
 My immediate goals are to become a professional front-end developer and get a job, release my game and pass IELTS exam with band 7.5+.

 ### Skills
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- C#

### Code Examples

  for(int i=0; i<number;i++)
    {
    if(i%3==0 && !(i%5==0)) sum=sum+i;
    if(i%5==0) sum=sum+i;
  }
  return sum;
}
